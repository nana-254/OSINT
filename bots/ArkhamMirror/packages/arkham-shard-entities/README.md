## Dependencies

### Required Services
- **database** - PostgreSQL 14+ for entity storage and persistence
- **events** - Event publishing

### Optional Services
- **vectors** - pgvector for vector similarity merge suggestions
- **entities** - Frame's EntityService for advanced features

### Infrastructure Notes
This shard uses PostgreSQL for all persistence. Vector similarity for entity matching uses pgvector when available. The single database dependency (PostgreSQL with pgvector extension) eliminates the need for external vector stores.

## URL State

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `entityId` | Active entity ID |
| `view` | View mode (list, detail, merge, relationships) |
| `filter` | Entity type filter |

### Local Storage Keys
- `column_widths` - Column width preferences
- `show_merged` - Show merged entities toggle
- `sort_preference` - Default sort preference

## Similarity Algorithms

### String Similarity
Uses Levenshtein (edit) distance normalized by string length:
- Exact match = 1.0
- Substring containment = 0.95 * (shorter/longer)
- Edit distance = 1.0 - (distance/max_length)

### Vector Similarity
When vectors service is available:
- Embeds both entity names
- Calculates cosine similarity
- Falls back to string similarity on failure

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest packages/arkham-shard-entities/tests/

# Type checking
