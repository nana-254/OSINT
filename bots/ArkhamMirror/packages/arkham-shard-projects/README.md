> Project workspace management with vector collection isolation

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Category:** System
**Frame Requirement:** >=0.1.0

## Overview

The Projects shard provides workspace management capabilities for SHATTERED, allowing users to organize documents, entities, and analyses into isolated workspaces. Each project can have its own vector collections with configurable embedding models, enabling project-scoped semantic search.

### Key Capabilities

1. **Project Management** - Create and configure project workspaces
2. **Vector Collection Isolation** - Project-scoped pgvector tables with configurable embedding models
3. **Document Grouping** - Associate documents with projects
4. **Permission Control** - Role-based access to project resources
5. **Activity Tracking** - Monitor project changes and member activity

## Features

### Project Workspaces
- Create projects with metadata (name, description, status)
- Project lifecycle management (active, archived, completed, on_hold)
- Project settings and custom metadata
- Member and document counts tracked automatically

### Vector Collection Isolation (pgvector)
- **Project-scoped tables**: Each project gets isolated vector tables in PostgreSQL
  - `project_{id}_documents` - Document embeddings
  - `project_{id}_chunks` - Chunk embeddings
  - `project_{id}_entities` - Entity embeddings
- **Configurable embedding models** per project
- **Automatic table creation** on project creation
- **Safe model switching** with dimension validation

### Supported Embedding Models

| Model | Dimensions | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | Default, fast general-purpose |
| `all-mpnet-base-v2` | 768 | Higher quality, slower |
| `BAAI/bge-m3` | 1024 | Multilingual, highest quality |
| `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | Optimized for paraphrase detection |

### Project Roles
- **Owner** - Full control over project
- **Admin** - Manage members and settings
- **Editor** - Add/edit content
- **Viewer** - Read-only access

### Project Status
- **Active** - Currently in progress
- **Archived** - Completed or inactive
- **Completed** - Successfully finished
- **On Hold** - Temporarily paused

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e packages/arkham-shard-projects
```

The shard auto-registers via entry point on Frame startup.

## API Examples

### Create Project with Vector Collections

```json
POST /api/projects/
{
  "name": "Investigation Alpha",
  "description": "Document analysis project",
  "embedding_model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  "create_collections": true
}

```json
PUT /api/projects/{id}/embedding-model
{
  "model": "all-mpnet-base-v2",
  "wipe_collections": true

    "project_abc123_chunks": {"vectors_count": 3200, "status": "green"},
    "project_abc123_entities": {"vectors_count": 89, "status": "green"}
  }
}
```
